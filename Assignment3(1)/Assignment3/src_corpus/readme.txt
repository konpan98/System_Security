ACCESS CONTROL LOGGING SYSTEM 
Everything works fine except for the file fingerprint that i had a problem of producing a different one for each file 



Access Control Log Monitoring tool
The monitor tool works fine . I didnt make any code for the test aclog .c but i checked it's functionality by editing the log file to check the conditions for the malicious users and the modifications (and to solve the problem with the fingerprints i mentioned above)

Test the Access Control Logging & Log Monitoring tools
I didn't write any code for this part but i checked the functionality of the tools as i mentioned above
